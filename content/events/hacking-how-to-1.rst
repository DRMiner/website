We expect students to come over at Tilda and discuss about how to motivate them properly. The last time we talked we have found that schools fail to motivate students. Everyone tells us that math is important for anyone interested in technic knowledge, and we study it but we rarely see why we need it.

What is the reason for the lack of the motivaation and what can we do to change it?

Join us in a dicussion!

This meeting is intened for sharing learning experiences and suggesting interesting topics and roadmaps for learning the art of hacking. Come and join us, it will be fun!
